# food_item_classification

This repository contains a Jupyter Source File on classifying various food items that i.e vegetables and fruits using CNN.
Here we have used transfer learning i.e EfficientNetB5 architecture to optimize our model even more.

The app.py file has the server code that can be used to create a FASTAPI server and uses a model already saved in .h5 format.

WILL UPLOAD DATASET LINK LATER....
